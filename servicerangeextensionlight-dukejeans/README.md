# Service Range Extension - Light

Increases the range of "service" purposed buildings by 25%. This amount was chosen in order to still require the occasional service building, while making it still feel as if you don't need two Temples, let's say, ontop of one another even though you have marble roads. Appropriate if you don't want to totally discredit the need of public service buildings and wonders, but don't want them crowding every other city block.
